# The GMS-License
Our default software License and related explanations.

## Why we needed an own License
GMS is actively contributing to various open source projects. 
While we support open source and OSS software, some of the software products we produce
are specifically made for our industry.

We are proud supporters of the following categories of usage:
* Self operated usage of our software (also with help of 3rd parties such as consultants and / or software developers)
* IT departments that want to use our software internally
* Any company of any size that wants to use our software internally or with customers
* Any NGO or education institution

While we would love to contribute just for pleasure of contributing, 
we had to draw some limitations to not harm our business activities 
that contribute the financial means to develop and sponsor
free software. 

Therfor following categories of commercial applications need additional licenses: 
* Any party that wants to offer our software hosted to third parties against a payment, solely or in conjunction with other products 

# FAQ regarding our License

## What am I allowed to do? 
You are allowed to use our software in any way you see fit on your own infrastructure and seek any kind of support to do so.
This includes you being a repair shop and using our software or using it an IT department or any other direct usage. 

## What am I not allowed to do? 
Use our software to provide services that are solely based on the use of our software. 
This includes offering our software without or with only minor modifications to provide the software itself as a service. 

## What if I want to offer this software as a services to third parties? 
In most cases there is absolutely no issue with that, we reserve the right to require you to close a license agreement with us to contribute financially to our software development though. Reach out to us and we can discuss a free fair use policy (for NGOs and education sector usage) or a sponsoring for our repositories in exchange for unrestricted licenses for your commercial use. 

## Why didn't we pick a preexisting license such as Affero or other dual use licenses?
We felt they were all too long and too complicated and wanted something easier to understand.
